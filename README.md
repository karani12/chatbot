jquery,ajax and php chatbot

## Huge step:

PHP was interesting for a while but now i neeeded to extend my learning.

I built this project in the process of learning

Ajax and jquery was all I knew.

## How it works
I used the class jquery library inorder to send messages to the backend. It was simple in such a way that It would check for similar questions in the database and if there was any that
was like it then it would reply with the answer otherwise it replied it didn't understand.

The response was appended into the document and it looked like a chat app where it is back and forth

The aim was to learn how to send requests to the backend without using the 
```
$_POST[]
```
## Twhat I used:
- Jquery
- PHP
- Ajax
-MYSQL
